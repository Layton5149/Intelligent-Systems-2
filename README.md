# AI-Powered Movie Recommendation Web App
this project is for my intelligent systems 2 module for university and is a lightweight recommender system and web app. It preprocesses the MovieLens 1M dataset, applies PCA for dimensionality reduction, and uses K-Nearest Neighbours to surface similar titles instantly. A Flask API powers a responsive Bootstrap/JavaScript frontend with autocomplete search and real-time recommendations. Versioned end-to-end with Git and GitHub.

Features: fast similarity search, PCA-compressed vectors, type-ahead movie lookup, instant recs. \n
Tech: Python, Flask, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, Bootstrap, JavaScript. \n
Data: MovieLens 1M.
